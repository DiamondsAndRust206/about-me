      <p>I am a person who trys to not take myself to seriously, but take pride in what I do. I grew up and graduated high school in North Carolina. Being from a small town and looking for something new I moved to Seattle soon after high school. I have been here ever since and really love the northwest.

      <p>Starting when I was a teenager I have worked in restaurants. My first job after moving to Seattle was a busser at a fine dinning restaurant. From there I learned enough to later become a server. After that I learned how to bartend which I would do for about fifteen years. During this time I would try to go to college for engineering. However, I had to work full time while going to school, and eventually I could not afford it any longer. In my quest to try and always learn something new is what brought me to coding bootcamp.</p>
    <p>Some of the things I like to do in no specific order:
      <ul>
        <li>Skateboarding</li>
        <li>Being at the climbing gym</li>
        <li>Reading(Mostly Non-fiction)</li>
        <li>Watching movies at the theater</li>
        <li>Camping and discovering the NW</li>
      </ul>
